# LLM vs RAG

## Introduction

This demo shows benefits of using retrieval augmented generation over vanilla LLM usage.

## Usage

### Basic example

1. Run an instance of Weaviate. 
2. Run `eg1_create_collection.py` to create a collection.
3. Run `eg2_import_arxiv.py` and `eg2_import_pdf.py` to import text data from various PDFs.
4. Run `streamlit run Demo_app.py` from your shell.

There is also a multi-modal example - documentation to come :).
